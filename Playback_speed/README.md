# Playback speed fix 

Videos obtained prior to 22/2/2022 endured variable resulting frame rates (as designated by the SpinView software) that were unequal to the specified acquisition frame rate.

This issue has been rectified, but to fix the data with variable playback speeds, this folder contains python code to 1) identify the resulting frame rate the video was recorded with and 2) rewrite the video to the original acquisition frame rate.
